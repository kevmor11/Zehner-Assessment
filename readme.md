# Zehner Assessment

Take-home project I completed as part of a job application assessment for Zehner. Did my best to throw together a rough mobile-version given that I only had Desktop assets to work with.

## Built With

* HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap

## Incomplete Features

* Drinks Section - Carousel

Given more time I could have built out an actual carousel in this section instead of just hardcoding the caroursel dots
